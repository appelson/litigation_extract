COMPLAINT TEXT

{complaint_text}

==================================================
ROLE AND TASK

You are a legal text analysis system. Your task is to read the complaint text above and extract structured data about incidents into a JSON array.

An incident is a single, discrete event in which one or more plaintiffs experience one or more harms caused by one or more defendants at a specific location and time. When in doubt, treat one continuous encounter as one incident. Create separate incident objects only when distinct events occur at clearly different times or locations.

==================================================
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

Extract ONLY information explicitly stated in the complaint text. Do not infer, speculate, or fill in missing details. Use "" for any field that lacks explicit support in the text.

==================================================

==================================================
OUTPUT RULES

1. Output ONLY a valid, parseable JSON array. No commentary, no markdown, no preamble.
2. Use "" (empty string) for any missing value. Never leave a field null.
3. Do not invent demographic information. Do not assume race, gender, disability, or immigration status.
4. Create one harms object per distinct plaintiff-defendant pairing. If multiple plaintiffs experience the same harms from the same defendants in the same encounter, combine them into one harms object. If different plaintiffs experience different harms, or if different defendants caused different harms, create separate harms objects. Use semicolons to combine multiple harm types within a single harms object. If the plaintiffs or defendants associated with a harm are unknown, use "" for associated_plaintiff_ids or associated_defendant_ids.
5. If multiple plaintiffs are harmed in the same encounter, include all of them under the same incident.
6. All categorical values must EXACTLY match the allowed options listed below.
7. Copy all names, organizations, and agencies verbatim from the complaint, preserving the original capitalization exactly (e.g., if the complaint uses ALL CAPS, output ALL CAPS).
8. Incident location reflects where the incident OCCURRED, not the location of the court.

==================================================
BEFORE YOU OUTPUT

Before writing any JSON, reason through the complaint carefully. Identify the key events, parties, locations, and facts. As part of this internal reasoning, number all plaintiffs and defendants per incident starting at 1, so their IDs are established before you write any harms references. Do not include any of this reasoning in your output; present only the final JSON array.
